## Huddlearn idea
Huddlearn is a place for finding your like-minded mates. Say someone wants to create a project, or a work of art. They want to find people with different skills, so they can create something beautiful and/or useful together, or someone wants to join a project, where they can show their skills, and be a part of something they would appreciate, or someone who  wants to find a study group to develop a certain skill. Huddlearn is where teammates learn, practice, create, and hold each other accountable.

Upon registration in the platform, users will be asked for their goals, interests, skills and aspirations. Huddlearn will do its best to find a perfect match. A list of groups that consist of people of similar goals and interests is shown. Then the user can select a group to join. 

Working on a collaborative project, studying and creating art together is something where responsibility is one of the keystones. One of the user scores on Huddlearn is accountability. In Study Groups there may be some plan, or agreement, or just a need of some constant activity. Working together in a Project Group also means that everybody respects each other and follows group agreement on the timeline. Accountability score gives users motivation, support constant participation, practice and self-development.
